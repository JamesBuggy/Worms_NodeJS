Requirements:
    Nodejs and NPM

Installation And Execution

    If you are using windows:

        You can run the ./install.bat file to install all needed NPM packages,
        followed by the ./start_all.bat file to start each server.

    If you are not using windows you will need to run the following commands in each sub directory:

        ./AngularClient
            npm install
            npm run-script ng serve

        ./GameServer
            npm install
            npm start

        ./MasterServer
            npm install
            npm start

        ./RestAPI
            npm install
            npm start


Configuration

    MongoDB Authentication

        To have the RestAPI use MongoDB authentication,
            Update the db_auth property in ./RestAPI/config.js

            The RestAPI is configured to use the following when authenticating with MongoDB:
                user: restApi
                password: Arml1bB4tMida


    Use Application From Remote Device (Phone/tablet/other PC)

        If you want to use the application from a remote device, you must replace
        'localhost' in the following files with the ip address of the PC hosting the servers:
            ./AngularClient/src/app/common/network.ts
            ./RestAPI/config.js
            ./GameServer/config.js
            ./MasterServer/config.js


    HTTPS (Does not work well on local networks due to browser errors/warnings)

        To enable https, update the use_https in the following configs:
            ./RestAPI/config.js
            ./GameServer/config.js
            ./MasterServer/config.js

        Also update the protocol property in:
            ./AngularClient/src/app/common/network.ts

            The AngularClient will also need to be started with the following command:
                npm run-script ng serve --ssl --ssl-key <path-to-key>  --ssl-cert <path-to-cert>

                The keys and certs are under:
                    ./AngularClient/ssl
